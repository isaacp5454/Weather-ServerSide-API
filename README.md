# Weather-ServerSide-API
## Project Description
This project challenges me to develop a weather app. First the progression of the HTML with a good foundation for both CSS and Javascript. I had to utilize the fetch API and Javascript to implement its functionality. That included retrieving and disaplying the current weather and a five-day forecast for searched cities. To further enhance the user experience, I also implemented the ability to save searched cities and display their respective weather information when clicked.
